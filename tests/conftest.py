# UNBOUND 200 - RACE BRIEF

## RADAR SCORES (1-5 each)

| Variable | Score | Justification |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Logistics | 3 | Emporia is remote, hotels book 6 months out |
| Length | 5 | 200 miles is brutal |
| Technicality | 2 | Mostly smooth gravel |
| Elevation | 3 | 11,000 ft over 200 miles |
| Climate | 5 | Heat kills - 103°F in 2023 |
| Altitude | 1 | Sea level |
| Adventure | 4 | Flint Hills are epic |

**PRESTIGE: 5/5** - The original gravel race.

## TRAINING PLAN IMPLICATIONS

**Protocol Triggers:**
- Heat Adaptation: Yes - Temps hit 103°F
- Altitude Protocol: No
- Technical Skills: No
- Durability Focus: Yes - Mile 80-95 breaks people
- Fueling Strategy: Yes - Aid stations sparse

**Training Emphasis:**
- Primary: Heat tolerance - Train in heat
- Secondary: Durability - Long rides
- Tertiary: Fueling - Practice eating

**THE ONE THING THAT WILL GET YOU:**
The heat. Your FTP doesn't matter if you overheat at mile 100.

## THE BLACK PILL

Unbound will break you. The truth is 30-40% DNF in hot years. Mile 80-95 is where people quit. The Teterville rollers come when you're already cooked. u/graveldude said it best: "Mile 130 is where dreams die."

## KEY QUOTES

"Mile 130 is where dreams die" - u/graveldude
"103°F and I was done" - u/heatstroke
"The rollers never end" - u/gravelrider

## LOGISTICS SNAPSHOT

Airport: Wichita (90 min drive)
Lodging: Book 6 months out
Packet pickup: Friday before race
Parking: Limited, arrive early
