Batch profile enrichment — adds biased_opinion_ratings explanations
to thin profiles using existing research dumps.

Reads existing profile + research dump, calls Claude API to generate
per-criterion explanations in Matti voice, merges result back.

Usage:
    python scripts/batch_enrich.py --auto 10        # Enrich top 10 priority
    python scripts/batch_enrich.py --slugs unbound-200 mid-south  # Specific races
    python scripts/batch_enrich.py --dry-run --auto 5  # Preview without writing
    python scripts/batch_enrich.py --auto 50 --delay 5 # Batch with 5s delay

RESEARCH DATA (includes community dumps with rider reports, terrain details, race strategy):

---

You are re-enriching these explanations because NEW community data (rider reports, race recaps, quotes) is now available that wasn't before. Your job:

1. KEEP everything good from the previous explanation (specific details, accurate claims)
2. REPLACE vague claims ("zero rider reports", "no evidence", "pure speculation") with specifics from the COMMUNITY FACT SHEET and research data above
3. ADD word-for-word quotes from riders — the more memorable, specific, and telling the better
4. NEVER fabricate section names, trail names, or rider quotes — only use what's in the research
5. Each explanation: 2-3 sentences. If the research data is thin, 1-2 sentences is better than padding.
   HARD LIMIT: Each explanation must be {max_explanation_len} characters or fewer ({community_kb:.0f}KB community dump).
   {"Short, factual statements only. One sentence per explanation is fine." if max_explanation_len <= 200 else ""}

VOICE AND TONE:
- Professional, sober, direct. Not stuffy — but not performing either.
- Let the quotes and facts carry the weight. Your job is to frame them, not upstage them.
- Droll is the ceiling. If there's a writerly reveal, it earns itself from the facts.
  Example of droll done right: "Bobby Kennedy describes the mile 81 climb as an 'unswitchbacked dirt bike trail.' It earns that description."
  Example of trying too hard: "The strongest riders are probably doing real races that weekend."
- Do NOT end explanations with a zinger, punchline, or snarky dismissal.
- Do NOT editorialize beyond what the data supports. If data is thin, be brief.

QUOTE RULES:
- Prefer direct rider quotes over your own paraphrasing. A quote in their words beats your summary.
- Every rider name you mention MUST be paired with something specific they said or did.
  GOOD: "Bobby Kennedy describes 'riding on the moon' through volcanic moondust terrain."
  BAD: "Riders like Josh Spector and Coach Dandelion gather annually in tiny Laona." (name-stuffing — names without substance)
- If a rider said something vivid, use their exact words in quotes. That's the whole point.
- Prioritize quotes with sensory detail, concrete specifics, or surprise. A quote about 'chains chewed,
  derailleurs gargled and spat' is worth ten quotes about 'great event, well organized.'
- If a rider only said generic things ("challenging course", "great experience"), don't quote them.
  Paraphrase briefly or skip. Only quote what's worth reading.

DISTINCT MATERIAL PER CRITERION:
- Each of the 14 criteria MUST use different supporting evidence.
- Do NOT reuse the same quote, anecdote, or detail across multiple criteria.
  Example: if Bobby Wintle hugs every finisher, that goes in ONE criterion. If you cite Bobby Wintle
  in another criterion, use a DIFFERENT fact — his route development, his cancellation handling, his
  decade of organizing. Not the hug again.
- Same rule for terrain features: if you cite Bovine Bypass in adventure, don't cite it again in value.
  Find different course features for different criteria.
- You CAN mention a rider in multiple criteria — just use different facts about them each time.
- When data is thin for a criterion, write a short honest assessment. Two sentences with no data beats four sentences of padding.

BANNED PATTERNS:
- Never use "legitimate", "genuine", or "real" as qualifiers. They assert specificity without providing it. Delete them.
- Never use "nobody's traveling from [place] for it" or equivalent dismissal punchlines.
- Never use "if [X] affects you here, [activity] isn't your sport" or equivalent snark closers.
- Never use "staying awake driving there" or similar bored-traveler jokes.
- Never use "bragging rights and total destruction" or similar overwrought contrast pairs.
- Never pad an explanation when data is missing. If there's no pricing data, one sentence: "No pricing data available." Stop there.
- Never use "not exactly [impressive thing]" as a formula. Just state what it IS.
- Never end an explanation with a punchline, zinger, or snarky dismissal. End on a fact or a quiet observation.

Output ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  {json_template}
}}

Rules:
- Keep the existing scores — don't change them
- Beat the previous explanation on every criterion — more specific, more community-sourced
- You MUST use rider names and terrain features from the COMMUNITY FACT SHEET
- Reference specific rider names, course features, weather data from the research
- No generic filler ("amazing experience", "world-class", "the fact that")
- No fake uncertainty ("zero rider reports") when the FACT SHEET lists real riders
- Output ONLY the JSON object, no markdown, no code blocks"""
